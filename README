*Because there's no place like home*

This is where I manage my dotfiles.
Please be aware that this is my "personal" approach to managing em.

## TODO
	- [ ] Manage everything with `nix`;
		Right now it's a mix of `nix` and `yay`, because I'm using Manjaro(based on arch btw, too noob for arch XD).
		It avoid me some problems, but I don't really like mixing up package manager.
