# dotfiles

_Because there's no place like home_

This is where I manage my dotfiles.
Please be aware that this is my "personal" approach to managing em.

## TODO

- [x] add [nixGL](https://github.com/nix-community/nixGL)
- [ ] Migrate some packages installed with `yay` to `nix`
    - [x] kitty
    - [ ] vscode
    - [ ] chrome
- [ ] Simplify import from the `nix` directory
- [ ] Setup [hyprland](https://hyprland.org/). _(Maybe, time consuming)_
